sha-512 is useful in validating the license file
aes, rsa are useful in encrypting and decrypting the data

SHA-512 is a hashing algorithm, and it's not designed for encryption and 
decryption. It's a one-way function, meaning that it can hash data, but you 
cannot reverse the process to obtain the original data.

Both AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) 
are widely used encryption algorithms, but they serve different purposes and 
are not directly comparable in terms of security. Here's a brief comparison:

Symmetric (AES):
Purpose: AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm, meaning the same key is used 
for both encryption and decryption.
Security: AES is considered highly secure when used with a strong key. Common 
key lengths are 128, 192, or 256 bits.
Performance: AES is efficient and performs well, making it suitable for 
encrypting data, files, and communication channels.

Asymmetric (RSA):
Purpose: RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm, which means it uses a 
public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
Security: RSA is also considered secure when used with sufficiently long key 
lengths, typically 2048 bits or more. However, RSA's security relies on the 
difficulty of factoring large numbers.
Use Case: RSA is commonly used for securing communications, digital 
signatures, and key exchange. It's not typically used for encrypting large 
amounts of data due to performance concerns.

Which is more secure depends on the context:
For securing communications, RSA is often used to exchange a symmetric AES 
key, which is then used to encrypt the actual data. This combination offers 
both security and efficiency. AES is more suitable for encrypting large 
volumes of data due to its performance. When used with strong keys, it's 
considered highly secure.

In summary, both AES and RSA can be secure when used properly with 
appropriate key lengths. The choice between them depends on your specific use 
case. For modern applications, AES is often the preferred choice for data 
encryption due to its efficiency and security, while RSA is used for tasks 
like key exchange and digital signatures.
